# Well, hello there stalker ðŸ˜„

I am Gedeon Obae Gekonge, a Software Engineer/DevOps Engineer/Cloud Developer. I write code daily...well, as frequently as I can.

I am experimenting ðŸ”­ with new technologies to build some interesting stuff :rocket: :hammer_and_wrench: that make our lives easier.

## &#x270d; Blog & Writing

Apart from coding, I also maintain a blog - you can find my articles on my [blog](https://hashnode.com/Gedeonobae)
